Hello Odin!
This is my second attempt at learning, I'm currently using my macbook because I have issues with my dual boot Linux, as well as my virtual machine. Unfortunate, but I must adapt. I'm grateful for the oppurtunities I have before me. I must strive to waste not, and continue purusing excellence and virtue before God.
